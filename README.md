# Amazon Vine Analysis

# Overview
The Amazon Vine program is a service that allows sellers, publishers, and manufacturers to get reviews on their products in exchange for compensation. However, there is concern that some of these reviews may be biased as they are in exchange for free product. In this analysis, we selected DVDs from a list of more than 50 item-specific data sets. First we set up our data pipeline, then using AWS and SQL created a database, then performed further analysis.
